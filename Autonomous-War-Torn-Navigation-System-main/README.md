# Autonomous-War-Torn-Navigation-System
•	Provide better alternative to rescue people from a war-torn region by using object-detection model and shortest path planning algorithm that would be computed over the drone and communicated over to the bot

•	Utilized YOLO’s object detection prowess, the object detection model undergoes transfer learning for precise classification of images such as fire, destroyed buildings, military vehicles, etc.

•	Used Bluetooth Communication to transfer the path to the bot. The path was created using a very unique path planning algorithm where the values were given on the nodes itself and not on the edges.
